            <h2>Why Ayrton Senna?</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing Ayrton Senna means recognizing not only one of the greatest athletes of all time  
                but also a symbol of perseverance and patriotism. His impact goes beyond Formula 1;  
                he inspires generations with his determination, courage, and relentless pursuit of excellence.  
                His iconic phrase, "If you want to be successful, you must have total dedication,  
                push yourself to the limit, and give your very best," reflects the spirit of a true champion.  
                <br><br>
                Even decades after his passing, Senna continues to be remembered and revered worldwide,  
                both by motorsport fans and those who draw inspiration from his journey.
