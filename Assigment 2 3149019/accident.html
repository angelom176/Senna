            <h2>Accident of 1994</h2>
            <p>
                The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Imola remains one of the darkest weekends in Formula 1 history.  
                Ayrton Senna, who had joined Williams that season in pursuit of a fourth world championship,  
                was struggling with the car’s performance due to new regulations that banned active suspension,  
                a system he had mastered at McLaren.  
                <br><br>
                The race weekend was already marked by tragedy. On Friday,  
                rookie driver Rubens Barrichello suffered a violent crash but survived with minor injuries.  
                On Saturday, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger lost his life during qualifying after  
                his car crashed at high speed. These events deeply affected Senna,  
                who spent the evening discussing safety concerns with FIA officials.  
                <br><br>
                On race day, May 1, 1994, Senna started from pole position.  
                However, on lap seven, while leading the race, his car went off the track at the high-speed Tamburello corner,  
                crashing into a concrete wall at nearly 220 km/h (137 mph).  
                The impact caused severe head injuries, and despite immediate medical attention,  
                Senna was pronounced dead later that afternoon.  
                <br><br>
                His passing sent shockwaves through the motorsport world, leading to significant safety reforms in Formula 1.  
                His legacy is honored through continued advancements in driver safety  
                and the work of the Ayrton Senna Institute, which helps improve education for children in Brazil.  
                Senna’s loss was a turning point in Formula 1, ensuring that no driver’s life  
                would be risked in vain.
