        <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p class="pLegacy">Beyond his achievements on the track, Senna left a legacy that extends far beyond motorsports. 
                He was admired for his work ethic, determination, and winning mentality. 
                His rivalry with Alain Prost is one of the most iconic in F1 history, helping to elevate the 
                sport to new levels of popularity. Off the track, Senna was a great philanthropist. 
                He cared deeply about Brazil and supported underprivileged children through anonymous donations. 
                After his tragic death at the San Marino Grand Prix on May 1, 1994, his family founded 
                the Ayrton Senna Institute, which continues to impact millions of young Brazilians through education.
